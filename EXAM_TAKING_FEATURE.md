### Route Structure:
```
/courses/[course]/[module_id]/evaluation/[evaluation_id]/
├── attempts/               # View all attempts for an evaluation
├── attempt/[attempt_id]/   # Take/continue an exam
└── attempt/[attempt_id]/results/  # Review completed attempt
```

- Question navigation with answered/unanswered indicators
- Auto-save with timestamp display
- Connection status monitoring

#### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive validation before submission
- Network connectivity awareness
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- User-friendly error messages

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

1. **Student views module** → sees both content and available evaluations
2. **Clicks evaluation card** → sees attempt history and status
3. **Starts new attempt** → enters full-screen exam interface
4. **Takes exam** → real-time timer, question navigation, auto-save
5. **Submits exam** → automatic scoring and redirection to results
6. **Reviews results** → detailed breakdown with correct answers
7. **Views history** → all attempts with performance tracking
