# Evaluation Management System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete evaluation management system for admins in the plataforma-cnre repository. The system allows admins to create and manage evaluations, questions, and answers within modules.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Question Handler (`/backend/internal/handlers/question.go`)
- Created complete CRUD operations for questions
- Routes: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE `/api/v1/questions/{id}`
- Special routes: 
  - GET `/api/v1/evaluations/{id}/questions` - Get questions by evaluation
  - GET `/api/v1/questions/{id}/answers` - Get question with answers

### 2. Answer Handler (`/backend/internal/handlers/answer.go`)
- Created complete CRUD operations for answers
- Routes: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE `/api/v1/answers/{id}`
- Special route: GET `/api/v1/questions/{id}/answers` - Get answers by question

### 3. DTOs Updated
- **question.go**: Added `CreateQuestionRequest` and `UpdateQuestionRequest`
- **answer.go**: Added `CreateAnswerRequest` and `UpdateAnswerRequest`

### 4. App Routes (`/backend/internal/app.go`)
- Uncommented questionService initialization
- Added questionHandler and answerHandler initialization  
- Added complete route definitions for questions and answers API endpoints

### 5. Swagger Documentation
- Added basic swagger docs structure to fix build issues

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Admin Module Page Enhanced
**File**: `/frontend/src/routes/(auth)/(platform)/admin/courses/[course]/[module]/+page.svelte`
- Added evaluations section alongside existing content section
- Enhanced to display both content and evaluations
- Added buttons to create new evaluations
- Implemented evaluation reordering functionality

**File**: `/frontend/src/routes/(auth)/(platform)/admin/courses/[course]/[module]/+page.server.ts`
- Added evaluation loading via EvaluationController

### 2. Evaluation Management Components

**EvaluationCard** (`/frontend/src/lib/components/evaluation/EvaluationCard.svelte`)
- Displays evaluation details (title, description, question count, passing score, time limit, etc.)
- Action buttons for editing, deleting, and managing questions
- Move up/down functionality for reordering
- Links to evaluation detail page

### 3. New Evaluation Creation
**File**: `/frontend/src/routes/(auth)/(platform)/admin/courses/[course]/[module]/new-evaluation/`
- Complete form for creating new evaluations
- Fields: title, description, question count, passing score, max attempts, time limit
- Validation and error handling
- Redirects to module page after creation

### 4. Evaluation Detail & Question Management  
**File**: `/frontend/src/routes/(auth)/(platform)/admin/courses/[course]/[module]/evaluations/[evaluation]/+page.svelte`
- Shows evaluation details and configuration
- Lists all questions in the evaluation
- Buttons to add new questions and edit evaluation settings
- Empty state when no questions exist

**QuestionCard** (`/frontend/src/lib/components/evaluation/QuestionCard.svelte`)
- Displays question details with type badges (single/multiple choice)
- Shows points, explanation, and answer preview
- Edit/delete action buttons
- Preview of correct/incorrect answers with color coding

### 5. Question Creation with Answer Management
**File**: `/frontend/src/routes/(auth)/(platform)/admin/courses/[course]/[module]/evaluations/[evaluation]/new-question/`

**Key Features:**
- **Question Types**: Support for single_choice and multiple_choice
- **Dynamic Answer Management**: 
  - Add/remove answers dynamically (minimum 2 required)  
  - Large answer bank support as requested
  - Checkbox selection for correct answers
- **Question Type Logic**:
  - Single choice: Only one answer can be marked correct
  - Multiple choice: Multiple answers can be marked correct
- **Validation**: 
  - Required fields validation
  - Answer correctness validation
  - Type-specific validation
- **Order Handling**: Order field ignored for display (as requested) but sent for backend compatibility

### 6. Controller Enhancements
**QuestionController** (`/frontend/src/lib/controllers/question.ts`)
- Added `getQuestionsByEvaluation(evaluationId)`
- Added `getQuestionWithAnswers(questionId)`

## Key Requirements Addressed ✅

1. **✅ Admin Evaluation Creation**: Admins can create evaluations within modules
2. **✅ Multiple Questions per Evaluation**: Each evaluation can have multiple questions  
3. **✅ Large Answer Bank**: Each question can have many answer options
4. **✅ Answer Text & Correctness**: Each answer has text and correct/incorrect indicator
5. **✅ Question Types**: Support for single_choice and multiple_choice questions
6. **✅ Order Ignored**: Answer ordering ignored for display (as requested)

## System Architecture

```
Admin Module Page
├── Content Section (existing)
└── Evaluations Section (new)
    ├── EvaluationCard (for each evaluation)
    └── Create New Evaluation Button
        └── New Evaluation Form
            └── Success → Evaluation Detail Page
                ├── Question Management
                ├── QuestionCard (for each question) 
                └── Create New Question Button
                    └── New Question Form with Answer Management
                        ├── Dynamic Answer Creation
                        ├── Correct/Incorrect Selection  
                        └── Question Type Selection
```

## Database Models Used
- **Evaluation**: Contains evaluation metadata (title, passing score, time limit, etc.)
- **Question**: Contains question text, type (single/multiple choice), points, explanation
- **Answer**: Contains answer text, is_correct flag, and question reference

## API Endpoints Available

## Implementation Notes
- **Code Consistency**: Maintained existing code style and patterns
- **No Tests**: As requested, no test files were created
- **UI Consistency**: Used existing UI components and styling
- **Minimal Changes**: Made surgical changes without affecting existing functionality
- **Spanish Language**: All UI text in Spanish to match existing application
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback with toast messages
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with appropriate error messages

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready evaluation management system that integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
